# QR Generator

This program provides a web interface to generate a QR code with an image embedded in it. I am attempting to create QR codes that are resilient to "quishing" attacks. I have QR codes that are deployed to public areas to send people to informational website. These QR codes are in areas where it is possible for someone to tamper with them by overlaying their own sticker/image.
